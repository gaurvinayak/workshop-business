# WorkshopOS

> Open-source business management software for small rig / workshop / fabrication businesses.
> One place for attendance, payroll, inventory, purchasing, invoicing, and basic accounting.

**Status:** Phase 1 (MVP) implemented and validated end-to-end — attendance, payroll, inventory, purchasing, invoicing, and accounting all working, with the double-entry ledger staying balanced across every transaction type. See [`docs/PHASE-1-STATUS.md`](docs/PHASE-1-STATUS.md) for what's built and how it was verified, and [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md) to run it locally. Phase 2 refinements (PDFs, email, quotations, leave balances, self-service) follow per the [roadmap](docs/06-roadmap.md).

## Why this exists

Small workshop businesses (machine shops, fabrication units, rig builders, repair garages) typically run on a pile of Excel sheets. That works until it doesn't: stock counts drift, payroll math gets copied wrong, invoices go missing, and nobody can answer "did we actually make money last month?"

WorkshopOS is a single, self-hostable app that covers the day-to-day operations of a ~10-person workshop:

- 🕘 **Attendance** — clock in/out, shifts, overtime, leave
- 💰 **Payroll** — salary structures, attendance-driven pay, statutory deductions, payslips
- 📦 **Inventory** — products, raw material, spare parts, multi-location stock
- 🛒 **Purchasing** — suppliers, purchase orders, goods receipt, stock-in
- 🧾 **Sales & Invoicing** — quotations, customer invoices, payments
- 📒 **Accounting** — double-entry ledger, chart of accounts, basic financial reports

## Should you build this, or use ERPNext?

Be honest with yourself before writing code. A mature open-source ERP — **[ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/)** (Frappe) — already does *everything* on your list, plus manufacturing, and can be self-hosted with Docker in an afternoon. Odoo Community and Tryton are similar.

**Use an existing ERP if:** you mainly need it to *work* and you're willing to adapt your process to the software's. This is the right call for most 10-person shops.

**Build WorkshopOS if:** you want full control of the data model and UX, you have (or are) a developer who will own it, your workflow is unusual enough that configuring an ERP is as much work as building, or this is also a learning/portfolio project. This repo assumes you've chosen to build.

See [`docs/00-overview.md`](docs/00-overview.md) for the full build-vs-buy analysis.

## Quick mental model

        └───────────┘                                    └───────────────┘
```

Everything is **double-entry at the core**: inventory movements, payroll runs, and sales all post to the same ledger so "basic accounting" is a consequence of the design, not a bolt-on.

## Recommended hosting

A single **$10–20/month VPS** (2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM) running Docker Compose comfortably handles 10 employees with room to spare. Self-hosting is worth it here; you keep your payroll and customer data, and the running cost is a rounding error. See [`docs/05-security-and-ops.md`](docs/05-security-and-ops.md).

## License

Intended to be released under the **MIT** or **AGPL-3.0** license (decide before first public release). AGPL keeps hosted forks open; MIT maximizes adoption. TBD.
